# L-System-Tree-Generation

## Dartmouth CS77 23S

### Description
Using iterative L-System statement generation, render complex 3D trees and apply realistic textures.

### Implementation

All code for generating a tree is done in *main.cpp* and the textures for the tree and floor are done in *object_2.vert/object_2.frag* and *object_3.vert/object_3.frag*, respectively. 
An L-System statement is generated iteratively based on a ruleset and an initial statement. Using this iterative statement, a skeleton can be generated by following the instructions
of the statement. As the skeleton is being created, cylinders are computed to wrap around the inanimate skeleton of the tree. UV texture mapping is used to apply bark to trees and a mossy floor.
